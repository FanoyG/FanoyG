## 📌 About Me

<image src="https://github.com/FanoyG/FanoyG/blob/f0d63856d0d25a04593a86171acdfcd778a76f03/images/Screenshot%202025-03-10%20133852.png" alt="coding" align="right" width=290 style="margin-top: 10px" />

💡 My journey in tech has been fueled by **curiosity**.  
I started by exploring **different domains** — Python automation, cloud (AWS, Terraform), scripting, and backend projects. Each step gave me a new perspective and skillset.  

But after all this exploration, I finally found where my curiosity meets purpose: **Cybersecurity**.  

🔭 I’ve recently earned **Windows Fundamentals** and **Networking Fundamentals** badges from *LetsDefend* and started building my own **Windows Security Lab** and **SOC-style projects** to practice real-world defense skills.  

🎯 My focus now is clear: **grow as a SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Intern**, while leveraging my past automation & cloud experience to bring unique value to defense.
